NOTES ON USING DOCTRINE
-----------------------
Zikula supports Doctrine 1.2. Please make sure you are reading the correct version
of the documentation looking on the vendor website
http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/en

1.  It is not necessary to loadModels() except in specific conditions when it is
required.  Registering the module namespace (which happens automatically) is
enough.  This is the main advantage of using the PEAR class/file naming scheme.

2.  Models are required to tell Doctrine about the structure of a table.  But they
also allow additional behavior.
